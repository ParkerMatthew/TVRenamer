#Place Regex (Regular Expression) formatted anti-filteres here.
#These regex nonfilters will prevent important strings from being removed by the junk filter
#Lines starting with a # are comments and ignored by the program.
#You can test your Regex at http://regexr.com/
#Try to be very specific with these, to ensure actual junk is still removed
#The filters will be removed from the filename, then re-inserted with a space after it
#Filters that start and end with [brackets] will be re-injected without the brackets by default, but this can be changed in the settings

#Episode number formated as double episodes [1 - 2]
